# Framing Vulnerabilities: Dengue and Diarrhea in Peruâ€™s Borderlands

This section outlines the complete workflow used in this study, including data collection, processing, cleaning, and statistical analyses, along with the scripts used to perform each step. Our goal is to enable reproducibility, following best practices in open and replicable research.

## Content

* Step 1: Data Collection and Exploration (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/data-collection))

  Retrieving datasets considering the identified indicators through the literature review from gouvernamental and open-access sources. 
  
* Step 2: Data Preprocessing (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/data-preprocessing))

  Variables and proxy selection according to the literature review and relabelling for downstream analysis, aligning temporal and spatial resolutions, and preparing datasets for modeling. Re-labelling of the variables to ease its use. Removing missing values and inconsistencies to evaluate the structure and granularity of the data.
  
* Step 3: Further Refinement of the Data, Data Compilation and Statistical Analysis (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/data-refinement-and-compilation))

  Compilation of the datasets into a unified database, ensuring consistency across all sources. Statistical analysis and data visualization.
