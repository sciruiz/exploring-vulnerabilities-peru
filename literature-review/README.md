**Overview**

This literature review compiles and analyses diverse scientific efforts that aim to model or assess **vulnerability to dengue** through socio-environmental, epidemiological, and structural indicators. You will find:

- A variety of **methodologies** used to quantify or model dengue vulnerability, including both **statistical and expert-based approaches**.
- A consistent focus on **susceptibility, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity**, as core dimensions of vulnerability.
- A detailed breakdown of **indicators most frequently used** across studies: climatic (e.g., temperature, rainfall), demographic (e.g., population density, age structure), and socioeconomic (e.g., education, healthcare access).
- Insight into how these indicators are operationalized into indices or models, many influenced by **WADI (World Risk Index)** frameworks.

This synthesis includes 30+ studies conducted across the globe, with particular attention to **systematic reviews**, **spatial modeling**, and **validation efforts** relevant to Latin America and Southeast Asia.

**Methodology**

The review encompasses a wide range of methods, which are distributed as follows:

Most Common Approaches:
- **Systematic Reviews** (6+ studies)
- **Spatial/Statistical Modeling** (3 studies)
- **Meta-Analyses and Expert-Based Models**
- **Regression, Correlation, and Time-Series Analyses**
- **Entomological and Cohort Studies** (including longitudinal and retrospective designs)

Example Modeling Techniques:
- **Weighted indicators** using expert elicitation or data-driven methods
- **Pearson correlation matrices** to reduce redundancy among indicators
- **GIS-based spatial modeling** to map risk areas
- **Socio-ecological autopsy** approaches for comprehensive assessment
- Integration of **survey data, remote sensing, and entomological datasets**

Most methodologies triangulate **environmental**, **demographic**, and **infrastructural data** to produce indices reflecting risk exposure and community vulnerability.

**Summary of Main Findings**

**Conclusion**

This literature review offers a robust synthesis of how vulnerability to dengue is conceptualized and measured across disciplines. Most studies align around three pillars—**susceptibility, coping, and adaptation**—but differ in how they operationalize these. The growing trend toward **spatial modeling and composite indices**, often incorporating real-time or high-resolution data, marks a significant shift in how we understand disease risk.

For future applications, especially in **Latin America**, this body of work provides essential methodological and conceptual guidance for the development of **locally adapted vulnerability indices**. These indices not only improve **targeting of public health interventions**, but also enable **predictive modeling** under changing climatic and urbanization conditions.

## Diarrhea Disease Literature Review on Environmental Determinants and Vulnerability Indicators
![Peru Vulnerabilities Diarrhea Framework](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/blob/main/literature-review/Peru%20Diarrhea%20Framework.png)
Figure 2. Vulnerability factors identified for diarrhea-related disease through the non-systematic literature review. Italicized indicators do not have supporting Peru-specific literature. (*) References have pathogen specific relationships with indicators. 

**Overview and Scope**

This literature review investigates the relationship between environmental stressors—particularly drought, rainfall, and temperature fluctuations—and the incidence of diarrheal diseases. It also identifies key sociodemographic and adaptive capacity indicators that exacerbate or mitigate vulnerability to such diseases. The reviewed studies range from 2014 to 2021 and span multiple geographies including the Pacific Islands, the United States, Peru, and Korea.

**Methodology**

The review applied a structured search using terms such as “droughts diarrhea”, “diarrhea vulnerability index”, and related variants through Google Scholar. Selection of studies was guided by inclusion criteria emphasizing relevance to climate-linked diarrheal outcomes, measurable associations, and methodological rigor.

To ensure quality and consistency in analysis, three critical appraisal tools were employed:

- PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for systematic reviews (maximum score: 27),
- JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool) for observational studies (maximum score: 8),
- Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort and cross-sectional studies (maximum score: 9).

**Summary of Main Findings**

*Environmental Stressors and Diarrhea Incidence:*

- Temperature increases were positively associated with national-level diarrheal trends in Peru, with stronger associations during El Niño events.
- Heavy rainfall following dry periods significantly increased diarrheal risk, particularly in regions with inadequate water treatment infrastructure.
- Drought conditions were linked to compromised hygiene behaviors and increased household water insecurity, especially among children under five.

*Sociodemographic and Susceptibility Indicators:*

- Age emerged consistently as a vulnerability indicator—especially in children under two and between 12–34 months.
- Other identified factors included food insecurity, limited hygiene practices, and restricted access to safe water.
- Differences in vulnerability by sex and maternal education level were also observed in some datasets.

*Coping and Adaptive Capacity:*

- Coping mechanisms included reliance on government or household water reserves, alternative water sourcing, and water treatment practices.
- Adaptive strategies were less commonly reported but included:
-   Health education interventions,
-   Investment in water treatment infrastructure,
-   Early warning systems related to ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) and extreme weather.

*Quality of Evidence:*

- Studies using multivariate analysis and cohort designs generally scored higher on the NOS and JBI tools (e.g., 9/8).
- The sole systematic review achieved a PRISMA score of 24/27, reflecting good methodological rigor though it lacked practical implementation discussion.

**Conclusion**

This review underscores the urgent need for climate-resilient public health systems, particularly in low-resource settings where environmental shocks are increasingly frequent. The most vulnerable populations—young children in water-insecure households—face compounded risks from both environmental exposure and systemic gaps in adaptive capacity.

Future work should prioritize integration of environmental surveillance with public health datasets, and investment in both infrastructural and educational adaptive strategies. Moreover, standardizing methodologies across studies will improve comparability and meta-analytic potential.
