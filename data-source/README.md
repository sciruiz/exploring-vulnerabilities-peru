Note: Peru’s political and administrative organization is structured in a hierarchical manner, with four main levels: region, departments, provinces, and districts. The first division consists of departments (departamentos), also referred to as regions (regiones). Peru has 25 of these: 24 departments plus the Constitutional Province of Callao, which holds the same status as a department. Each department has a regional government responsible for planning and executing policies in areas such as education, health, transport, and economic development within its boundaries. Examples of departments include Cusco, Piura, Loreto, Arequipa, and Lima.

Departments are further divided into provinces (provincias). There are 196 provinces across the country, each governed by a provincial municipality. Provincial governments oversee urban development plans, inter-district transport systems, and certain public works. For instance, the Department of Cusco contains provinces such as Cusco, Urubamba, La Convención, and Canchis.

Provinces are subdivided into districts (distritos), which form the most localized level of government. Peru has 1,874 districts, each managed by a district municipality responsible for community-level services, such as waste management, maintenance of local infrastructure, and regulation of neighborhood commerce. For instance, in the case of Cusco Province, its districts include Cusco, San Sebastián, San Jerónimo, Santiago, and Wanchaq.
