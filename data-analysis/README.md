# Framing Vulnerabilities: Dengue and Diarrhea in Peru’s Borderlands

This section outlines the complete workflow used in this study, including data collection, processing, cleaning, and statistical analyses, along with the scripts used to perform each step. Our goal is to enable reproducibility, following best practices in open and replicable research.

## Content

* Step 1: Data Collection (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/data-collection))

  Retrieving datasets with the identified indicators through the literature review from gouvernamental and open-access sources.
  
* Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploration (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/data-cleaning%20))

  Removing missing values and inconsistencies to evaluate the structure and granularity of the data.
  
* Step 3: Data Preprocessing (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/data-preprocessing))

  Variables and proxy selection according to the literature review and standardisation for downstream analysis, aligning temporal and spatial resolutions, and preparing datasets for modeling.
  
* Step 4: Further Refinement of the Data and Data Compilation (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/data-refinement-and-compilation))

  Integrating processed datasets into a unified structure, ensuring consistency across all sources. Compilation of all datasets to a single master database. 
  
* Step 5: Statistical Analysis (see more [here](https://github.com/sciruiz/framing-vulnerabilities-peru/tree/main/data-analysis/statistical-analysis))

  Applying analytical and inferential methods to address the study objectives.
