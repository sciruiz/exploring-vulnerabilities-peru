# Exploring Vulnerabilities for Dengue and Diarrhea in Peru 

This repository supports the study "Exploring Vulnerabilities: A mixed-method Transdisciplinary Study of Dengue and Diarrhea in Peru" (Mezza et. al., submitted to the Special Issue of _The Journal of Climate Change and Health_). The research examines how climate variability, socio-environmental factors, and health outcomes intersect in Caballococha an area identified as critically affected by local health authorities., a Peruvian Amazonâ€™s border region.

Our approach integrates quantitative and qualitative analyses within a transdisciplinary framework, combining climate and epidemiological data with on-the-ground perspectives from community stakeholders. The repository provides all materials necessary for transparency and reproducibility, including a literature review with quality-scoring rubrics, complete data analysis workflows, and scripts programmed during the study.
